Project Overview

The Supermarket Billing System is a C++ application designed to streamline the process of billing and managing product inventories in a supermarket. This system allows users to add, update, and delete products, generate bills for customers, and maintain a record of transactions.
Features

    Product Management-:
        Add new products to the inventory.
        Update product details (e.g., price, quantity, and name).
        Delete products from the inventory.

    Billing System-:
        Create bills for customers based on selected products.
        Calculate total amounts, including applicable taxes or discounts.
        Print itemized bills.

    Transaction Record:-
        Maintain a log of transactions for future reference.

    User-Friendly Interface:-
        Console-based menu-driven interface.
        Easy-to-navigate options for users.

Requirements Software:

    C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
    IDE (optional but recommended): Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or Dev-C++.

Hardware:

    A system with basic configurations to run a C++ program.

Setup Instructions:

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ahsumon77/supermarket-billing-system.git
cd supermarket-billing-system

Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

g++ -o billing_system main.cpp

Run the executable:

    ./billing_system

File Structure:

    main.cpp: Entry point of the program.

Future Improvements

    1. Integration with a database for persistent storage.
    2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
    3. Support for multiple user roles (e.g., cashier, manager).
    4. Implementation of discount and loyalty programs.
